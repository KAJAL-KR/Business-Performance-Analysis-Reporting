# Business-Performance-Analysis-Reporting
 Overview: You are working as a Junior Data Analyst at a company that tracks sales and customer information. Your manager has shared a dataset containing sales transactions, and you’ve been assigned to analyze it to uncover trends, patterns, and generate summary reports.

Your role is to clean the dataset, analyze key business metrics, generate visualizations, and export reports — using only Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The goal is to simulate a real-world reporting workflow based on company data.
